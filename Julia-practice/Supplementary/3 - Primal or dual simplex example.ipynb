    "In this example, we will show how the selection between primal and dual simplex has impacts on performance. Solvers typically decide whether to apply primal or dual simplex by trying them concurrently or picking one as default. \n",

    "In general, the are no set rules that can guarantee that one will perform better than the other. Some elements might serve as indication, such as having a significantly difference in the number of variables and constraints, or the occurence of degeneracy in the primal or dual. As a general guideline from numerical experience, dual simplex tends to perform better than primal simplex, but there are several cases where primal simplex can be shown to be best performing.\n",

For a problem like the one being generated, typically dual simplex will perform better, since a dual feasible basis is easily available in this case. Notice that solving it with primal simplex there is a report of primal infeasibility at first, meaning that a feasibility phase is employed. Later, we only see dual infeasibility, which, as we seen in class, is equivalent to \"lack of optimality\". When the problem becomes dual feasible, it means it found a primal optimal solution.    "
